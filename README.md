# PowerBI-Project
Reporting &amp; Insights on global e-commerce dataset


My project is centered around the Global Superstore dataset from 2011 to 2014 obtained from Kaggle. This dataset provides insights into sales, profitability, and consumer behavior by combining extensive retail data from several countries and product categories. The dataset contains data on product features, consumer demographics, sales transactions, and geography information.



The information includes sales records from several channels, such as websites, physical stores, and offers a comprehensive picture of the retail environment, encompassing a wide range of product categories like furniture, electronics, office supplies, and more.

 It also contains attributes that allow for in-depth analysis and segmentation, such as product category, sub-category, and area.
