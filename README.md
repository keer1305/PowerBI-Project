Reporting &amp; Insights on global e-commerce & Sales dataset

Project 1:
**PROJECT E-COMMERCE :**
My project is centered around the Global Superstore dataset from 2011 to 2014 obtained from Kaggle. This dataset provides insights into sales, profitability, and consumer behavior by combining extensive retail data from several countries and product categories. The dataset contains data on product features, consumer demographics, sales transactions, and geography information.



The information includes sales records from several channels, such as websites, physical stores, and offers a comprehensive picture of the retail environment, encompassing a wide range of product categories like furniture, electronics, office supplies, and more.

 It also contains attributes that allow for in-depth analysis and segmentation, such as product category, sub-category, and area. 

Project 2:
**PROJECT AVACADO SALES:**

My data set represents the weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price in the table reflects a per unit cost, even when multiple units are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados are not included in this table.


I downloaded the data set from Kaggle. The data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018.
